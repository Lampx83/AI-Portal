# Machine Learning in Medical Diagnosis

## Introduction

The application of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is becoming an important trend. Deep learning models can support doctors in diagnosing disease from X-ray images, MRI, and clinical data analysis with increasingly high accuracy.

## Main applications

Key applications include:
- Medical imaging diagnosis: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) analyzes X-ray and CT scan images to detect cancer, lung lesions.
- Disease prediction: Models predict cardiovascular and diabetes risk based on patient data.
- Natural language processing: Extract information from electronic health records, support prescriptions.

## Challenges and future direction

Medical data is sensitive and requires strong security. Federated Learning allows training models without sharing raw data. Explainable AI helps doctors understand why a model makes a diagnosis, increasing trust in clinical practice.
